In this project, I created a fictional e-commerce database from scratch. I built multiple tables and designed an ER (Entity-Relationship) diagram to show the relationships between them using **Primary Keys** and **Foreign Keys**.

I wrote several SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from the data. The entire analysis process and results are explained in a Word document.

This project demonstrates my ability to design databases,understand relational data, and perform structured queries using SQL.
## Tools Used
